        <p>My commitment to excellence extends beyond being a reliable and productive member of my employer; I also prioritize treating colleagues with respect and dignity, and collaborating with them to foster their growth and development. As a compassionate and empathetic person, I take pride in coaching and supporting colleagues, particularly new hires, to build their confidence and become more effective contributors, which has also helped me grow as a potential leader.</p>

		  <p>As highlighted in my Personal Ethical Dilemma Paper, I recognize that I made a mistake by solely focusing on my colleague's situation and not considering the impact on other stakeholders associated with my employer. Now, I am committed to taking a step back when faced with conflicting values or stakeholder interests, analyzing the situation from multiple perspectives, identifying the root cause of the conflict, and making a fair decision that aligns with my values and benefits all parties involved.</p>
